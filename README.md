# stratux-webHud

stratux-webHud is a simple Html application that is displayed on a web page in the Chromium browser in Kiosk mode, running on the Stratux RPi itself.  You then use either a HDMI cable from the Stratux to a Hudly or other HDMI capable projector, or a 3.5mm TRRS cable from the composite video jack on the Stratux to the backup camera port on the Kivic HUD.   

An example of the 3.5mm  TRSS cable can be seen at http://www.l-com.com/audio-video-thinline-35mm-cable-assemblies-male-to-male-4-circuit-tip-ring-ring-sleeve-trrs

#Instructions for an absolute minimum footprint install on the Stratux raspbian stretch lite OS:

I used the wired nic on the Stratux RPi for downloading updates. Steps 4-6 below were taken directly from https://die-antwort.eu/techblog/2017-12-setup-raspberry-pi-for-kiosk-mode/  under the heading "Minimum Environment for GUI Applications."

   1.  sudo raspi-config
   
      a. select Advanced Options
      b. select Expand Filesystem
      c. allow system reboot
   
   2.  sudo apt-get update
   3.  sudo apt-get upgrade
   4.  sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xserver-xorg x11-xserver-utils xinit openbox
   5.  sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends chromium-browser
   6.  sudo nano /etc/xdg/openbox/autostart
      
Copy the lines from the file https://github.com/N129BZ/stratux-webHud/tree/master/startup_script and paste them at the bottom of your autostart file.
   
Recursively copy the hud folder to the stratux folder /var/www/
 
This should give you /var/www/hud/ and its subdirectories css, img, and js.
 
Reboot the Stratux RPi.  Using your favorite browser on iPad, phone, desktop, etc., join the stratux wifi network and go ahead and browse to http://192.168.10.1/hud/hud.html if everything is working, you should see an AHRS display with solid black background. Moving the Stratux should show very smooth movement of the AHRS (20 frames/sec.)
 
Once operation of the AHRS display is confirmed, plug your video cable and verify the HUD projector is working. (I'm using a Kivic HUD, I connected the Kivic HUD device via the 3.5mm TRSS composite video cable from the Stratux jack to the external camera jack on the back of the Kivic.)

If you need to tweak the view of the HUD screen, the div.hud class in the hud.css file can be edited at the setting transform: scale(x, y) to scale the 2 dimensions to your liking, or even rotate 180Â° if mounting the HUD from the top of the windscreen. It is suggested to not change values for masks and tapes, as they are calibrated by number of pixels to offset based on the speed, altitude, or heading values being applied.

There are also keydown events that are trapped in javascript, for performing most of the functions exposed by Stratux's REST interface. Currently, these will only work when viewing the HUD screen on your laptop/desktop:

    "c" or numeric keypad "1" will [C]age AHRS
    "a" or numeric keypad "2" will calibrate [A]HRS
    "s" or numeric keypad "3" will re[S]tart
    "g" or numeric keypad "4" will reset [G]meter
    "b" or numeric keypad "5" will re[B]oot"
    "k" or numeric keypad "7" will [K]ill (shutdown) stratux
    "l" or numeric keypad "0" will re[L]oad the web page (like after making adjustment to scale, etc.)
    "w" or numeric keypad "9" will toggle a [W]arn flag, this lets you know the HUD is in Proximity Warning Mode  
        
(Note: I am currently testing Bluetooth functionality on the Stratux RPi with a paired bluetooth numeric keypad. This would allow the functions above to be keyed in when in flight. Preliminary results are mixed. The Stratux has bluetooth disabled by default, it appears this is for optimization of the UART for the 2 SDR's. After enabling bluetooth, the keypad response is sluggish and hit or miss.)

The next steps I would like to do with this are:

(1) Add a configuration page where the user can enter their aircraft's V-speeds. Those V-speeds will be used to programmatically add the appropriate color bands on the speed tape on the left.  For now it will require editing either the /img/speed_tape.png image directly, or edit /img/speed_tape.svg and save it as a png image. The current speed_tape.png image has the V-speeds for my Zenith CH650. (Note, the blue color at 60KT and the letters "BG" above that is the Best Glide speed for the CH650.)

(2) Add to configuration the ability to set the criteria for displaying a traffic alert flag, e.g., "If another aircraft comes within X miles of me and plus or minus X feet from my altitude, display a red alert box with the aircraft's detailed information, including the AC identifier, distance, altitude, speed, and relative bearing from me."  

A HUGE THANKS goes out to John Marzulli for his work on an aircraft HUD, which inspired me to do this as a web app on the stratux itself. John's work can be found at: https://github.com/JohnMarzulli/StratuxHud.
